## Might We Recommend:
(1) Checking if your CMake is newer than 3.20 and upgrading if need be
(if you're doing so on ubuntu 20.04 use these instructions [https://gist.github.com/bmegli/4049b7394f9cfa016c24ed67e5041930])
(2) Take a deeper look into the package.xml for the control package - this talks to many packages and you might not have them
(3) For sure running the dependencies.rosinstall and following that rabbit hole as necessary for your system
